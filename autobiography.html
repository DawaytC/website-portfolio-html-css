                Hello there! Mabuhay! I'm <b>Dwight Cutad</b>, a proud Pinoy who started life in the Philippines
                and then took a detour to Qatar when I was just four.
                Yep, you heard it right! Most of my existence has been in the Middle East, which, honestly,
                felt like a far cry from my roots. But, for fate had a way of pulling me back to my origins
                by living in a household full of Filipino values.
            </span>
            <br>
            <br>
            <span class="section_autobiography_text_p1">
                Back in my early days, I was the poster child for your typical middle-class upbringing.
                Ah, those were the golden times – no adulting stress, just me and my <b>YouTube tech videos,
                    living the dream. Those videos became my obsession, captivating me in their digital grasp.</b>
                Soon, I was engrossed in gadget reviews, especially those featuring the iconic Apple products.

                <br>
                <br>
                Imagine this: a seven-year-old me, a mini-expert in device wizardry.
                Life was pretty peachy until that one fuzzy memory, an anniversary celebration at my school.
                The pièce de résistance? A raffle draw, complete with consolation prizes that could make any kid grin.
                But guess what? The grand prize, an iPhone 4s fresh off the assembly line, stole the show.
                With my ticket clenched in hand, I confidently approached the counter, handed it over, and awaited destiny.

                <br>
                <br>
                Fast forward to the event, a sea of anticipatory faces, and my heart thumping like a tribal drum.
                The moment of truth arrived. I graciously handed my fate to the host, promptly fleeing the stage.
                But what's this? A distant echo of my own voice piercing the crowd, declaring me a winner.
                Stunned expressions, gasps of disbelief – I basked in a spotlight of pure childhood elation.
                To put it mildly, I was floating on a cloud of happiness larger than my seven-year-old self.

                <br>
                <br>
                As time rolled on, my YouTube addiction had grown roots deep enough to make anyone envious.
                In fact, it sparked a dream within me: becoming a bona fide YouTuber.
                I know, I know, every teenager's moonshot, right?
                But, here's the kicker: I wasn't just drawn to gadgetry,
                but also to the art of <b> capturing moments through photography and videography.</b>

                <br>
                <br>
                Fast forward to high school, where every design project was a canvas for my creative antics.
                Posters, short films, ads – you name it, I'd take it and give it my unique twist.
                Then, a plot twist came in the form of 2020 – ah, the dreaded COVID era. Amidst the chaos,
                I stumbled upon a new fascination: website design. My early attempts at crafting digital beauty were probably
                not all that beautiful, but hey, practice makes perfect, right? 2020 also marked the year when reality finally
                slapped me into taking the decision I had long avoided – choosing Software Engineering as my university major.
                With grim determination, I set out on a mission to master this new venture, to conquer the digital realm.

                <br>
                <br>
                Time flew, and I completed my Senior High School chapter in Qatar,
                leaving behind friends who were the pillars of my support system. Together, we volleyed balls,
                vanquished foes in Valorant, explored the city's secrets, shared meals, and wrote unforgettable stories.
                But as I flipped the page to a new chapter, it was a bittersweet farewell. Off I went to Malaysia for my bachelor's degree,
                leaving dear friends behind.

                <br>
                <br>
                In this new land, the first year at
                
                    <a href="https://www.upm.edu.my">Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM)
                        <i class="fa-solid fa-up-right-from-square"></i>
                    </a>
            
                felt like a wild rollercoaster.
                Adapting without my family by my side was a challenge, but lo and behold, life had plans.
                The universe conspired to bring some wonderful souls into my orbit,
                showering me with fruitful friendships.
                <b>Opting for Computer Science was a decision of pure bliss,
                    an opportunity to chase after my dreams.Truly, I am blessed.</b>

                <br>
                <br>
                <b>The future remains a hazy enigma. Yet, my journey toward a degree in Computer Science holds the promise of fulfilling my
                    aspirations to be a web developer.</b> This, my friends, is my tale – a journey filled with twists, dreams, and the occasional iPhone surprise.
                I am Dawayt, and this is my autobiography in all its quirky glory.
